 * Intercept Orders - Command Card

 * - type: "CONSTANT" → category: "command" (for Command card main/action effect)
 * - description → text
 * - action → actions: [action] (convert LegacyAction to EffectAction)
 * - Removed: restrictions, costs, conditions (not represented in new Effect)
 * - Added: targeting (derived from legacy action.target)
