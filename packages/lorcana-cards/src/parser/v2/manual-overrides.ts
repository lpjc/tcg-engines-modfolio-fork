/**
 * Manual Overrides for Complex Card Texts
 *
 * Some card texts are too complex to parse generically. This module provides
 * a way to manually define the JSON representation for such texts.
 *
 * Cards can have multiple abilities, so entries can be either:
 * - A single AbilityWithText object
 * - An array of AbilityWithText objects (for multi-ability cards)
 *
 * ## Implementation Status
 *
 * Many complex abilities use effect types not yet implemented in the engine.
 * These entries document the intended structure for future implementation.
 * As the engine type system evolves, these can be properly typed.
 *
 * ## Type Safety Note
 *
 * The entries use runtime objects that bypass TypeScript's strict checking
 * to allow documenting ability structures before the corresponding types exist.
 * This is intentional - the structures serve as specifications for future
 * type system extensions.
